# Sports Venues CRUD app

## Live Link
* https://warm-crag-60935.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies Used
* HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, Express.js, Mongo Atlas, Mongoose, EJS, Heroku

## Approach Taken
* RESTful routes to populate and navigate the database of sports venues and the front-end interface for that database.

## Unsolved Problems / Future Features
* Implementing users/session auth such that users can leave comments/reviews in a chosen venue and also "favorite" venues, which would then appear at the top of any full or filtered list that contains the "favorited" venues. 
* Error handling when fields are given unexpected values.
